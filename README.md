## 📌 About Me

Hi, I'm **Mohd Ajmal Raza** – a backend developer specializing in **Node.js**, **Express**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Supabase**.  
I enjoy building scalable APIs, integrating external services, and writing clean, testable code.

This portfolio is a reflection of my journey, tech stack, and projects I’ve built along the way.
